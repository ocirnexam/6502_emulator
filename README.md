# Emulator for the 6502 Microprocessor

## Description

This project is a complete emulator for the classic MOS Technology 6502 8-bit microprocessor, implemented in modern C++. The emulator supports the full official 6502 instruction set, including all addressing modes and status flag behaviors, and accurately replicates the original CPU's timing and logic.
Key Features

    âœ… Full implementation of all 56 (planned) official 6502 instructions

    ðŸ§  Accurate simulation of registers: A, X, Y, SP, PC, and PS (status flags)

    ðŸ“¦ Emulation of memory access and memory-mapped I/O

    ðŸ›  Written in C++

    ðŸ§ª Unit testing with the Unity Test Framework (planned)

    ðŸ”§ Designed for debugging and having fun deep-diving into CPU execution

6502 Architecture Highlights

    - 8-bit CPU with a 16-bit address bus (64KB memory address space)

    - Three general-purpose 8-bit registers: A (accumulator), X, and Y

    - Stack implemented via a fixed page (page 1: addresses $0100â€“$01FF) and 8-bit stack pointer

    - Rich set of addressing modes: immediate, zero-page, absolute, indexed, indirect, relative, etc.

    - Simplicity and efficiency made it a cornerstone of early computers (e.g., Apple II, Commodore 64, NES)

## Current State

Implemented Functions:
- LDA (all addressing types)
- LDX (all addressing types)
- LDY (all addressing types)
- LSR (all addressing types)
- JMP (direct & indirect)
- JSR (no return instruction yet)

## Usage

When the emulation runs, a command promt is shown below the current register status.
You can choose between:
- s (step) to step one instruction
- r (run) to finish the program
- q (quit) to exit the program
